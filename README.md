# yolov7-Pyside6 Image and Video Inference with UI


This project is based on [YOLOv7](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15hrCM2OF30o5S4bpa5fD8nrVFm4aDjht?usp=sharing) & [PyQt5-YOLOv5](https://github.com/Javacr/PyQt5-YOLOv5)

When the GUI is launched, it will automatically detect the presence of the [YOLOv7 models](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/releases/) that were previously added to the "ptmodel" folder.


With this project, our aim was to offer end users quick inferences that would simplify their work. To achieve this, we focused on developing a lightweight and fast project that would meet their needs.

    CPU : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10750H CPU @ 2.60GHz   2.59 GHz
